mezmerize engine

note: this is my first project im planning on making public eventually.. forgive how awful my setup and style is PLEASE

what is this?
an engine similar to the source engine but with modern oop practices like Components!!! and stuff this is not gonna rival anything it sucks its terrible BUT HOPEFULLY you may be able to dissect some info out of this project i guess.

why did i make this?
the whole unity incident got me makin my own stuff from scratch and i really like how the source engine and idtech stuff got going on and i really do not like unreals style and eh godot is okay but i love jst like flat brick type engines where you dont got no fancy editors its just u and your compiler kising and making out 

licensing: i havent figured this bit out yet. idk. dont do commerical stuff or something idk no ones gonna read this i can say anything jhere uhh nine alaven

what i want it to be:
NOT a dumb ooh realistic game engine cause like man just use unreal those guys at epic are great this is more lowkey and stylized or something im really into like blinn phong type stuff where its just ugly but it has a unique charm to it thats what i kind of want this to be ya know like old but with enough pizazz ..  todo: finish this spiel
